# Readme
This is my personalalization of the awesome editor which is [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/). These include: 

## Open Command window here
file opencmd.py takes care of this. It provides a right click menu for any file you are editing saying ***Open Command Window here***. clicking that opens up a command window in the current directory of the file.

## Codechef specific Modifications
